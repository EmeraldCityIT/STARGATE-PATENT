# STARGATE-PATENT

Molecular scanning and remote intentional printing.

Object is scanned by entrance portal to obtain detailed, accurate lattice structure.

Entrance portal breaks down particles using vibrational fields.

Entrance Portals Store subatomic particles (cubits) for "guaranteed return" material.

Exit portal generates scanned lattice structure.

Intention of biologial life drives the animated particles freely as individuals transported through some kind of interdimensional relocation.
