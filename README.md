# STARGATE-PATENT
molecular scanning and remote intentional printing.

Entrance portal breaks down particles using vibrational fields.

Entrance Portals Store cubits of subatomic particles for "guaranteed return" material.

Exit portal generates scanned lattice structure.

Intention of biologial life drives the animated particles freely as individuals transported through some kind of interdimensional relocation.
