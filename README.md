# STARGATE-PATENT

Molecular scanning and remote intentional printing.

The object is scanned by the entrance portal to obtain a detailed, accurate lattice structure.

The entrance portal breaks down particles using vibrational fields.

Entrance portals store subatomic particles (cubits) for "guaranteed return" material.

The exit portal generates a scanned lattice structure from the reservoir of subatomic particles.

The intention of biological life drives the animated particles freely as individuals transported through some kind of interdimensional relocation.
